ldesc: "Oxygen-Gtk is a port of the default KDE widget theme (Oxygen), 
to GTK+. It's primary goal is to ensure visual consistency between 
GTK+-based and Qt-based applications running under KDE. A secondary 
objective is to also have a stand-alone nice looking GTK+ theme that 
would behave well on other Desktop Environments."
